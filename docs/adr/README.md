# Architecture Decision Records

Capture in-the-moment decisions with immediate pros and cons weighed.

Not prescriptive - starting points to revisit as understanding evolves. Useful for aligning humans and LLMs while the decision stands.

When a decision changes, append a new ADR that references and supersedes the previous.
