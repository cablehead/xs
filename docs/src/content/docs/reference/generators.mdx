import { Link } from '../../../utils/links';

cross.stream generators use <Link to="nu" /> closures to create streams of data
that are emitted as frames into the store.

## Basic Usage

To create a generator, append a Nushell script that evaluates to a configuration
record with a `run` closure using the topic `<topic>.spawn`:

```nushell
r#'{
  run: {|| ^tail -F http.log | lines }
}'# | .append log.spawn
```

The generator will:

- Execute the provided Nushell expression
- Output from the pipeline is streamed as `log.recv` frames. Text pipelines emit
  one frame per line, while `ByteStream` pipelines send binary chunks.
- Automatically restarts if it exits until a terminate frame is seen

All frames produced by the generator use the same context as the `.spawn` frame
so multiple contexts can run generators with the same topic independently.

## Lifecycle Events

Generators emit lifecycle events to track their state:

| Event                 | Description                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `<topic>.start`       | Generator has started processing        |
| `<topic>.recv`        | Output value from the generator         |
| `<topic>.stop` | Generator pipeline has stopped. The \`meta.reason\` field is a string enum with values `finished`, `error`, `terminate` and `update`. When `finished` or `error`, the pipeline will be restarted automatically; `terminate` means it was stopped manually and the generator loop for this topic/context will shut down. `update` indicates the generator reloaded due to a new `.spawn` frame. |
| `<topic>.spawn.error` | Error occurred while spawning generator |

All events include `source_id` which is the ID of the generator instance. When a `.stop` frame has `meta.reason` set to `update`, it also includes `update_id` referencing the spawn that triggered the reload.

## Configuration Options

| Option   | Type    | Default | Description                                                         |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `duplex` | boolean | false   | Enable sending input to the generator's pipeline via `<topic>.send` |
| `return_options` | record | â€” | Customize output frames (see Return Options) |

The `return_options` field controls the suffix and TTL for the `.recv` frames produced by the generator.

## Bi-directional Communication

When `duplex` is enabled, you can send data into the generator's input pipeline
via `<topic>.send` frames:

```nushell
# Create a websocket connection
r#'{
  run: {|| websocat wss://echo.websocket.org | lines },
  duplex: true
}'# | .append echo.spawn

# Send input to the websocket: note the "\n", wss://echo.websocket.org won't
# reply until it sees a complete line
"hello\n" | .append echo.send
```

When running this generator:

- Lines received from the websocket server are emitted as `<topic>.recv` frames
- Content from `<topic>.send` frames is sent to the websocket server

## Error Handling

If a generator encounters an error during spawning a `<topic>.spawn.error` frame
is emitted with:

- `source_id`: ID of the failed spawn attempt
- `reason`: Error message describing what went wrong

The generator also appends a `<topic>.stop` frame with `meta.reason` set to
`spawn.error` so the failed instance can be cleaned up.

## Stopping Generators

To stop a running generator, append a frame with the topic `<topic>.terminate`.
The generator will stop and emit a `<topic>.stop` frame with `meta.reason` set to
`terminate`.

Appending a new `<topic>.spawn` frame while a generator of the same topic and
context is running reloads it with the new script. If the reload fails to parse,
you'll see a `<topic>.spawn.error` frame, and the previous generator continues
running.
