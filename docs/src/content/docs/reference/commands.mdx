cross.stream commands use <Link to="nu" /> expressions to define reusable
operations that can be called on-demand with arguments. Unlike handlers which
maintain state between invocations, or generators which run continuously,
commands are stateless and execute independently each time they are called.

## Defining Commands

To create a command, append a definition string with the topic
`<command-name>.define`:

```nushell
r#"{
  process: {|frame|
    # frame.topic - always <command>.call
    # frame.hash - contains input content if present
    # frame.meta.args - contains call arguments
    let input = if ($frame.hash != null) { .cas $frame.hash } else { null }
    let n = $frame.meta.args.n
    1..($n) | each {$"($in): ($input)"}
  }
}"# | .append repeat.define
```

The command definition requires:

- `process`: A closure that receives the call frame and can return a pipeline of
  results

Each value in the closure's output pipeline becomes a `.recv` event
automatically.

## Calling Commands

Commands are called by appending to `<command-name>.call` with input content and
arguments:

```nushell
# Call the repeat command with input and args
"foo" | .append repeat.call --meta {args: {n: 3}}
```

## Lifecycle Events

Commands emit events to track their execution:

| Event                | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `<command>.recv`     | Output value from the command's pipeline |
| `<command>.complete` | Command execution finished successfully  |
| `<command>.error`    | Error occurred during command execution  |

All events include:

- `command_id`: ID of the command definition
- `frame_id`: ID of this specific invocation

## Error Handling

If a command encounters an error during execution, it will:

1. Emit a `<command>.error` frame with:
   - The error message
   - Reference to both command_id and frame_id
2. Stop processing the current invocation

Unlike generators, commands do not automatically restart on error - each
invocation is independent.

## Key Differences

| Feature        | Commands                | Handlers               | Generators      |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| State          | Stateless               | Stateful between calls | Stateless       |
| Execution      | On-demand               | Event-driven           | Continuous      |
| Results        | Streamed immediately    | Batched on completion  | Streamed        |
| Parallelism    | Multiple parallel calls | Sequential processing  | Single instance |
| Error Handling | Per-invocation          | Unregisters handler    | Auto-restarts   |
