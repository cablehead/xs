import { Link } from '../../../utils/links';

cross.stream commands use <Link to="nu" /> expressions to define reusable
operations that can be called on-demand with arguments. Unlike handlers which
maintain state between invocations, or generators which run continuously,
commands are stateless and execute independently each time they are called.

## Defining Commands

To create a command, append a definition string with the topic
`<command-name>.define`:

```nushell
r#'{
  # Required: Command closure
  run: {|frame|
    # frame.topic - always <command>.call
    # frame.hash - contains input content if present
    # frame.meta.args - contains call arguments
    let input = if ($frame.hash != null) { .cas $frame.hash } else { null }
    let n = $frame.meta.args.n
    1..($n) | each {$"($in): ($input)"}
  }

  # Optional: Module definitions
  modules: {
    "my-util": "export def format [x] { $\"formatted: ($x)\" }"
  }

  # Optional: Control output frame behavior
  return_options: {
    suffix: ".output" # Output topic suffix (default: ".response")
    ttl: "head:1" # Keep only most recent frame
  }
}'# | .append repeat.define
```

The `return_options` field controls the suffix and TTL for the `.response` frame
produced by the command. TTL only applies to this `.response` frame—`.error`
events never expire.

The command definition requires:

- `run`: A closure that receives the call frame and can return a pipeline of
  results

All values produced by the closure's output pipeline are collected into a single
`.response` event automatically.

## Calling Commands

Commands are called by appending to `<command-name>.call` with input content and
arguments:

```nushell
# Call the repeat command with input and args
"foo" | .append repeat.call --meta {args: {n: 3}}
```

## Lifecycle Events

Commands emit events to track their execution:

| Event                | Description                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `<command>.response` | Collected result of the command pipeline |
| `<command>.error`    | Error occurred during command execution  |

All events include:

- `command_id`: ID of the command definition
- `frame_id`: ID of this specific invocation

## Error Handling

If a command encounters an error during execution, it will:

1. Emit a `<command>.error` frame with:
   - The error message
   - Reference to both command_id and frame_id
2. Stop processing the current invocation

Unlike generators, commands do not automatically restart on error - each
invocation is independent.

## Modules

Commands can use custom Nushell modules:

```nushell
r#'{
  run: {|frame|
    my-math double ($frame.meta.args.number)
  }

  modules: {
    "my-math": "export def double [x] { $x * 2 }"
  }
}'# | .append calculator.define
```

This allows you to modularize your commands and reuse code across different commands.

## Contexts

Command definitions and calls are scoped by context. Defining the same command
name in two different contexts creates two independent commands. Calls are
processed only when a matching definition exists in the same context;
otherwise the call is ignored.

## Built-in Store Commands

When the `run` closure executes it can use several helper commands provided by
cross.stream:

- `.append` – append a new frame. Metadata you provide is merged with
  `command_id` and `frame_id`.
- `.cat` – read frames from the command’s context.
- `.head` – fetch the most recent frame for a topic in this context.
- `.cas` – read content from CAS by hash.
- `.get` – retrieve a frame by ID.
- `.remove` – delete a frame from the stream.

`cat` and `head` default to the command’s context, while `append` accepts an
explicit context flag if you need to write elsewhere.

## Key Differences

| Feature        | Commands                | Handlers               | Generators      |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- |
| State          | Stateless               | Stateful between calls | Stateless       |
| Execution      | On-demand               | Event-driven           | Continuous      |
| Results        | Streamed immediately    | Batched on completion  | Streamed        |
| Parallelism    | Multiple parallel calls | Sequential processing  | Single instance |
| Error Handling | Per-invocation          | Unregisters handler    | Auto-restarts   |
| Modules        | Supported               | Supported              | Not supported   |
