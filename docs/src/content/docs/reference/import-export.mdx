The supervisor exposes two endpoints to facilitate data transfer between stores:

- POST `/import`: Takes JSON frame data and imports it as-is, preserving frame `id` and content `hash`
- POST `/cas`: Stores posted content in CAS and returns its hash

## Commands

`xs.nu` provides two commands to utilize these endpoints:

```nushell
# Export store at $env.XS_ADDR to path
.export <path>

# Import dump at path to $env.XS_ADDR
.import <path>
```

The exported data includes:
- Frame metadata in `frames.jsonl`
- Content files in `cas/` directory

## Version Compatibility

Version 0.1.0 was the first version supporting imports, though the 0.1.0 client can export data from 0.0.9 stores.

## Example

```sh
# Export from remote store
with-env {XS_ADDR: "https://user:token@remote-store.example.com"} {
    .export backup
}

# Import to local store
with-env {XS_ADDR: "./store"} {
    .import backup
}
```
