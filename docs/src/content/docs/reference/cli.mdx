| `--clean`   | Remove previously installed files        |

Without options the command prints the module contents so it can be redirected or piped.

Example:

```sh
xs nu --install
```

The `xs.nu` module provides Nushell-friendly convenience functions that wrap these CLI commands with pipeline support and environment awareness. See the [xs.nu reference](/reference/xs-nu/) for detailed documentation of all available functions.

### `scru128`

Generate and manipulate SCRU128 IDs. [SCRU128](https://github.com/scru128/spec) is a sortable, clock and random number-based unique identifier.

```sh
xs scru128 [COMMAND]
```

#### Generate a new ID

Generate a single SCRU128 ID:

```sh
xs scru128
```

Example:

```sh
xs scru128
# => 03d4q1qhbiv09ovtuhokw5yxv
```

#### `unpack`

Unpack a SCRU128 ID into its component fields:

```sh
xs scru128 unpack <ID>
```

| Option | Description                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `<ID>` | SCRU128 ID string, or `-` to read from stdin |

The output is a JSON object with the following fields:

- `timestamp` - Unix timestamp as float (milliseconds precision)
- `counter_hi` - 24-bit high counter value
- `counter_lo` - 24-bit low counter value
- `node` - 32-bit entropy/node field as hex string

Examples:

```sh
xs scru128 unpack 03d4q1qhbiv09ovtuhokw5yxv
# =>
# {
#   "timestamp": 1693000000.123,
#   "counter_hi": 1234,
#   "counter_lo": 5678,
#   "node": "abcd1234"
# }

echo "03d4q1qhbiv09ovtuhokw5yxv" | xs scru128 unpack -
```

#### `pack`

Pack component fields into a SCRU128 ID:

```sh
xs scru128 pack
```

Reads a JSON object from stdin with the same format as `unpack` output.

Example:

```sh
echo '{"timestamp":1693000000.123,"counter_hi":1234,"counter_lo":5678,"node":"abcd1234"}' | xs scru128 pack
# => 03d4q1qhbiv09ovtuhokw5yxv
```

Round-trip example:

```sh
xs scru128 | xs scru128 unpack | xs scru128 pack
```
