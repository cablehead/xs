import { Aside, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import { Link } from '../../../utils/links';

<Tabs syncKey="installer">

<TabItem label="cargo">
```sh
cargo install cross-stream --locked
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="brew">
```sh
brew install cablehead/tap/cross-stream
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Verifying Installation

```sh
xs --version
```

## Import `xs.nu`

<Aside title="optional">

`xs` is designed to be orchestrated with <Link to="nu" />, but it also works
great with a any POSIX shell, so this step is optional.

</Aside>

If you've never used <Link to="nu" /> before, you're in for a treat. If you're
ready to give it a try, visit their site and install it.

You'll then want to import `xs.nu`.

This will add some `.command` conveniences to your session. The commands
default to working with a `./store` in your current directory. You can
customize this by setting `$env.XS_ADDR`.

(TODO: add a reference for `Nushell` and `xs.nu`).

```nushell
use xs.nu *
```
