## Verifying Installation

```sh
xs --version
```

## Import `xs.nu`

<Aside title="optional">

`xs` is designed to be orchestrated with <Link to="nu" />, but it also works
great with any POSIX shell, so this step is optional.

</Aside>

If you've never used <Link to="nu" /> before, you're in for a treat. Visit the
Nushell site to install it, then install the `xs.nu` helper module:

```sh
xs nu --install
```

This copies `xs.nu` into your Nushell scripts directory and creates an
autoload stub so the commands are available in every session. You can also run
`xs nu` without options to print the module contents and install it manually.

After installation, import the module:

```nushell
use xs.nu *
```

The commands default to working with a store at `~/.local/share/cross.stream/store`.
You can point commands at another location by setting `$env.XS_ADDR`.
For quick, ad-hoc changes use `with-env`:

```nushell
with-env {XS_ADDR: "./store"} { .cat }
```

The `xs` command-line tool still requires the store path to be specified
explicitly (for example `xs serve ./store`).
