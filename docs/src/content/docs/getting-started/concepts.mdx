cross.stream is built around four fundamental concepts that work together to
create a powerful and flexible event streaming system: the event store,
generators, actors, and commands. Let's explore how these components interact
and complement each other.

## Event Store: The Foundation

At its core, cross.stream is an event store - a specialized database that
maintains an append-only log of events. Think of it as a ledger where each entry
(called a frame) represents something that happened, complete with metadata
about when and how it occurred.

Each frame has a unique [SCRU128](https://github.com/scru128/spec) ID that increases in value over time, ensuring frames maintain their temporal ordering. You can generate and manipulate these IDs using the [`xs scru128`](../../reference/cli/#scru128) CLI command.

The event store provides a few key capabilities:

- **Append-only writes**: New events can only be added to the end of the stream,
  preserving the historical record
- **Content separation**: Event metadata is stored separately from content,
  optimizing for both quick scanning and efficient content storage
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Clients can follow the stream live, receiving new
  events as they occur

This design makes the event store particularly good at maintaining an accurate
history of what happened and when, while still being efficient to query and
process.

## Processing Components

### Generators: The Producers

Generators are like automated watchers that produce new events into the stream.
They run as background processes, monitoring for specific conditions or changes
and emitting corresponding events when they occur.

For example, a generator might:

- Watch a log file and emit new lines as events
- Monitor a websocket connection and turn incoming messages into events
- Periodically check a system's status and emit health events

### Actors: The Reactors

Actors provide a way to react to and process events in the stream. They are
like event-driven functions that wake up when new events arrive, process them
according to rules you define, and optionally produce new events in response.

An actor might:

- Transform events into new formats
- Trigger external actions in response to events
- Aggregate or analyze event data
- Create chains of event processing

### Commands: The On-demand Processors

Commands are reusable operations that can be called on-demand with input data.
Unlike generators which run continuously, or actors which maintain state,
commands are stateless and execute independently each time they are called.

A command might:

- Make an HTTP request and stream back SSE responses
- Transform input data in a complex way
- Interact with external services

## Component Comparison

| Aspect           | Generators                            | Actors                        | Commands                     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Purpose          | Produce events from external sources  | Process existing events       | Perform on-demand operations |
| Execution        | Continuous background process         | Event-driven                  | Called on-demand             |
| State            | Stateless                             | Maintains state between calls | Stateless                    |
| Output           | Immediate streaming                   | Buffered until completion     | Immediate streaming          |
| Error Handling   | Auto-restarts (with a 1-second delay) | Unregisters                   | Per-invocation               |
| Typical Use Case | Watch external sources                | Transform/react to events     | Reusable operations          |

## Incremental Adoption

One of the strengths of cross.stream's design is that you can start simple and
gradually add complexity as needed:

1. **Start with the Event Store**
   - Begin by just using the store to record and query events
   - Get comfortable with the basic append/read operations
   - Use it like a specialized database

2. **Add Generators**
   - When you need to automatically capture events from external sources
   - Start with simple file watchers or API monitors
   - Let generators feed your event stream

3. **Introduce Actors**
   - As you need to process or react to events
   - Start with simple transformations
   - Build up to more complex event processing chains

4. **Define Commands**
   - When you need reusable, on-demand operations
   - Encapsulate common operations
   - Use for streaming interactions with external services

## Working Together

These components create a flexible architecture where:

1. **Generators** feed events into the system from external sources
2. **Actors** process those events, maintaining state if needed
3. **Commands** provide reusable operations that can be called on-demand
4. The **event store** ensures everything is reliably recorded and retrievable

For example, you might have:

- A generator watching system metrics
- An actor that processes those metrics and detects anomalies
- A command that can be called to fetch additional data when an anomaly is
  detected
- The event store maintaining the complete history of metrics and analysis
