# Automated Release Process

Execute the complete release workflow for cross-stream/xs project.

## Pre-flight Checks

Current repository status: !`git status`

Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

Last few releases: !`git tag --sort=-version:refname | grep -v dev | head -5`

## Release Steps

### 1. Pre-Release Information Gathering

**Ask the user for the following before starting:**
- Cargo registry token (if not already set in environment)
- Confirm the version number: $ARGUMENTS

### 2. Version Management

- Update version in Cargo.toml to $ARGUMENTS
- Run `cargo check` to update Cargo.lock
- Generate changelog from commits since last stable release

### 3. Review Release Notes

**⚠️ REVIEW REQUIRED**: The release notes have been generated in
`changes/$ARGUMENTS.md`. Please review them carefully:

- Check that all important changes are highlighted appropriately
- Edit the highlights section to focus on user-facing improvements
- Ensure the changelog is accurate and complete

**Do not proceed to the next step until you are satisfied with the release
notes.**

### 4. Git Operations

- Commit changes with message: `chore: release $ARGUMENTS`
- Create and push git tag `v$ARGUMENTS`
- This triggers GitHub workflow to build cross-platform binaries

### 5. Wait for CI Completion

- Get the latest workflow run ID: `gh run list --limit 1`
- Monitor build with: `gh run watch <run-id> --exit-status`
- Wait for all three builds to complete (linux-amd64, linux-arm64, macos-arm64)
- Verify GitHub release: `gh release view v$ARGUMENTS`
- Ensure all artifacts are uploaded (macOS, Linux AMD64, Linux ARM64 tarballs)
- **Important**: Verify release notes are set correctly with `gh release view v$ARGUMENTS --json body`
- If release body is just the commit message, update it: `gh release edit v$ARGUMENTS --notes-file changes/v$ARGUMENTS.md`

### 6. Homebrew Formula Update

- First check available assets: `gh release view v$ARGUMENTS`
- Download macOS tarball and calculate SHA256:
  ```bash
  cd /tmp
  curl -sL https://github.com/cablehead/xs/releases/download/v$ARGUMENTS/cross-stream-v$ARGUMENTS-macos.tar.gz -o cross-stream-v$ARGUMENTS-macos.tar.gz
  sha256sum cross-stream-v$ARGUMENTS-macos.tar.gz
  ```
- Update `../homebrew-tap/Formula/cross-stream.rb` with new version, URL, and SHA256 checksum
- Commit and push homebrew formula changes

### 7. Manual Verification Required

**⚠️ CRITICAL: macOS Verification BEFORE Publishing to Crates.io**

After homebrew formula is updated, **PAUSE** and ask a macOS user to test:

```bash
brew uninstall cross-stream  # if previously installed
brew install cablehead/tap/cross-stream
xs --version  # should show v$ARGUMENTS
```

**STOP HERE if verification fails.** Publishing to crates.io is irreversible.

### 8. Cargo Registry Publication

**Only proceed after macOS verification passes.**

- Use the cargo token provided in step 1: `export CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN="..."`
- Run `cargo publish` to publish to crates.io
- **Warning**: This step cannot be undone - you cannot unpublish from crates.io

### 9. Website Update (Final Step)

**Only after cargo publish succeeds:**

- Get the release published timestamp: `gh release view v$ARGUMENTS --json publishedAt --jq '.publishedAt'`
- Update `../www.cross.stream/www/index.html` release badge:
  - Update `version` attribute to `v$ARGUMENTS`
  - Update `release-date` attribute to the timestamp from GitHub (ISO 8601 format)
  - Update `release-url` attribute to `https://github.com/cablehead/xs/releases/tag/v$ARGUMENTS`
- Commit and push website changes to make the release publicly visible

## Release Complete

The release is now public! Summary:
- ✅ GitHub release: https://github.com/cablehead/xs/releases/tag/v$ARGUMENTS
- ✅ Homebrew: `brew install cablehead/tap/cross-stream`
- ✅ Crates.io: `cargo install cross-stream`
- ✅ Website updated: https://cross.stream

## Rollback Plan

If verification fails **before cargo publish**:

1. Delete the git tag:
   `git tag -d v$ARGUMENTS && git push --delete origin v$ARGUMENTS`
2. Delete the GitHub release: `gh release delete v$ARGUMENTS`
3. Revert homebrew formula changes
4. Investigate and fix issues before retry

**Note**: If cargo publish has already completed, you cannot unpublish from crates.io.
You would need to publish a new patch version with the fix instead.
