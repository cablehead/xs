# We use this --cfg for documenting the cargo features on which an API
# is available.  To preview this locally use:
# `RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg n0_future_docsrs" cargo +nightly doc --all-features`
# We use our own n0_future_docsrs instead of the common docsrs to avoid
# also enabling this feature in any dependencies, because some indirect
# dependencies require a feature enabled when using `--cfg docsrs` which
# we can not do.  To enable for a crate set
# `#![cfg_attr(n0_future_docsrs, feature(doc_auto_cfg))]` in the crate.
