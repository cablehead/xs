## Highlights

### A Major Rework of Handlers

https://github.com/cablehead/xs/wiki/Handlers

- Prior to this release, handlers had virtually no error handling. Now, when an error occurs, handlers will unregister themselves and record the error in the unregister frame's metadata.
- The handlers closure shape is now `{|frame, state| ... }`, meaning the frame is passed as an argument instead of being supplied as `$in`.
- Treatment of return values has been normalized: there is no longer any difference between handler return values for stateful and stateless handlers. By default, non-empty return values are appended as `<handler>.out` (previously it was just `<handler>`).
- You can configure the return value suffix and TTL using the return_options in the metadata of the handler registration frame.
- `.append` calls from a handler are now batched and processed together *after* the handler successfully completes. They aren't yet emitted in a fjall atomic batch but will be in the future. handler_id, frame_id, and state_id (if there is state) are now automatically included in the metadata of these appended frames.
- Stateful handlers now communicate state updates by appending a `<handler>.state` frame.
- A handy trick is to set the return value suffix to `.state`: then your return value will become the next state value for the subsequent handler call.

### Miscellaneous

- You can now import from one store into another: https://github.com/cablehead/xs/wiki/Export-and-Import
- The CLI client can now access stores behind HTTPS and BasicAuth
- Two new TTL options for frames:
    - `time:<milliseconds>`: the frame will exist for the specified number of milliseconds
    - `head:<count>`: keeps the most recent `count` frames for a given topic; among other uses, this is useful for using `xs` as a KV store

## Breaking Changes

- See handlers notes above
- fjall dependency has been upgraded from 1.5 to 2.4
- $env.XSPWD has been renamed to $env.XS_ADDR
- `xs pipe` has been renamed to `xs process` -- .pipe -> .process
