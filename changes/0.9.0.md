# v0.9.0

## Highlights

- **Hierarchical topics replace contexts** (breaking): Context isolation has been removed. Topics now support hierarchical organization (e.g., `user.id1.messages`) with wildcard queries (`--topic user.*`).

- **Reworked streaming semantics** (breaking): Clearer naming throughout:
  - `.head` → `.last`
  - `--tail` → `--new`
  - `--last-id` → `--after`
  - New `--from` flag (inclusive counterpart to `--after`)
  - New `--last <n>` flag for tail-like behavior

- **exec renamed to eval** (breaking): `xs exec '<script>'` is now `xs eval -c '<script>'`. File evaluation: `xs eval <addr> <file>`.

- **Append route changed** (breaking): `POST /<topic>` → `POST /append/<topic>` to avoid collision with reserved routes.

- **SQLite in nushell pipelines**: sqlite commands are now available within nushell scripts.

- **fjall upgraded to v3** (breaking): Storage engine updated to fjall 3.0.

- **Nushell 0.110**: Updated embedded nushell to 0.110.0.
