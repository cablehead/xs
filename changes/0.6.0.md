# 0.6.0

## Breaking Changes

### Handler Lifecycle Suffix Changes

Handler lifecycle events now use more consistent naming:

- `<handler-name>.registered` → `<handler-name>.active`  
- `<handler-name>.unregistered` → `<handler-name>.inactive`

**Migration:** Update any code that monitors handler lifecycle events to use the new suffix names.

### Generator Lifecycle Suffix Changes  

Generator lifecycle events now use more descriptive naming:

- `<topic>.start` → `<topic>.running`
- `<topic>.stop` → `<topic>.stopped` 
- `<topic>.shutdown` → `<topic>.inactive`

**Migration:** Update any code that monitors generator lifecycle events to use the new suffix names.

### Command Ready Event

Commands now emit a `<command>.ready` frame when successfully defined, indicating they are ready to accept calls.

## Highlights

* Standardized lifecycle event naming across handlers, generators, and commands
* Improved consistency in status reporting with `.active`/`.inactive` suffixes  
* Enhanced visibility into command readiness with new `.ready` events
* Better alignment between documentation and implementation
