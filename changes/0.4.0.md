## Highlights

- Reworked [Generators](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/reference/generators/):
  improved lifecycle (hot reload, terminate, restart)
- Introduced [Commands](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/reference/commands/):
  commands are stateless, on-demand operations with `<command-name>.define`
  scripts; trigger with `<command-name>.call`; output collected in
  `<command-name>.response`
- Added [Contexts](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/reference/contexts/): isolate
  data and definitions; operations default to the current context; use `-c` flag
  for cross-context access; manage contexts with `.ctx` commands.

### Miscellaneous

- Upgraded Nushell Engine to v0.104.0.
- Standardized scripting for handlers, commands, and generators using `run`
  closures run within Nushell Jobs.
- `xs-meta` header now uses Base64 encoding for reliable Unicode support.
- CAS now supports binary data.
- `xs head` now has a --follow flag to watch for updates
- Added helper commands to install the `xs.nu` Nushell module
  (`xs nu --install/--clean`).
- Build improvements (MUSL binary, Docker tags).

## Breaking Changes

- Removed the separate HTTP API listener (`xs serve --http`).
- Data and definitions are now partitioned by contexts; operations default to
  the current context, requiring updates for scripts assuming a single global
  namespace.
- Generators are now configured with `.spawn` scripts returning a configuration
  record with a `run` closure
- Handler scripts now require a `run` closure (instead of `process`) within the
  configuration record.
- The `xs-meta` header value must now be Base64-encoded JSON for Unicode
  support.
- The internal topic index ordering has changed.
