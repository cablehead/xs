## Highlights

- `.get` is now available as an internal `nu` command (for handlers)
- We have a new docs site, powered by [astro starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) âœ¨

### Handlers

- `env` is now preserved from your handler configuration script and between handler calls. This makes it convenient to set variables, e.g. access tokens, from your configuration script and to preserve state between handler calls.
- Your configuration script can now specify [modules](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/reference/handlers/#configuration-record-fields) to load for your handler.

### Miscellaneous

- Nushell to v0.101.0 ðŸš€
- Fjall to 2.4.4 ðŸš€
- Improved tracing / logging

## Breaking Changes

- There is no longer the concept of "stateful" handers, which take a second argument for state. Since `env` is preserved between handler calls, you can use that to store state.
- All configuration for handlers has been moved from the frame metadata to a configuration script.
- The handler configuration script now returns a table of configuration options instead of the closure.
