## About

cross.stream is a local-first event stream store that turns any CLI tool into a
reactive component. Stream data through Nushell pipelines, spawn external
processes as generators, and build handlers that automatically respond to
events.

Unlike traditional databases that store state, cross.stream captures the _flow_
of events over time. This enables powerful patterns like real-time monitoring,
automated workflows, and seamless integration between different tools and
services. Think of it as the missing piece that connects your favorite CLI tools
into a cohesive, reactive system.

Whether you're building personal automation, prototyping distributed systems, or
just want to pipe data through creative workflows, cross.stream provides the
foundation for event-driven computing on your local machine.

## Quick Start

See the
[installation guide](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/getting-started/installation/)
to get started.

## Features

- **Reactive Workflows**: Build handlers that automatically respond to events as
  they flow through the stream
- **CLI Integration**: Turn any command-line tool into a streaming component
  with generators
- **Nushell Native**: First-class integration with Nushell for powerful data
  processing pipelines
- **Real-time Streaming**: Subscribe to live event feeds and build responsive
  applications
- **Content Addressable**: Efficient storage and deduplication of large payloads
- **Local-first**: Your data stays on your machine, no cloud dependencies
  required
