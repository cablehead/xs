`xs` is a local-first event stream store for personal projects.
Think of it like [`sqlite`](https://sqlite.org/cli.html) but specializing in the
[event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) use case.

See the [documentation](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/) for detailed
installation instructions, tutorials and examples.
