> `xs` is a local-first event stream store for personal projects.
Think of it like [`sqlite`](https://sqlite.org/cli.html) but specializing in the
[event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) use case.

See the [documentation](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/) for detailed
installation instructions, tutorials and examples.

## Quick start

```sh
# install
cargo install cross-stream --locked
# or:
brew install cablehead/tap/cross-stream
brew services start cablehead/tap/cross-stream  # starts a store in ~/.local/share/cross.stream/store

# optional Nushell helpers
xs nu --install
# then in Nushell
use xs.nu *

# start a server
xs serve ./store

# in another window
echo "hello" | xs append ./store notes
xs cat ./store

# the xs.nu helpers fall back to ~/.local/share/cross.stream/store
# to use a different location temporarily:
with-env {XS_ADDR: "./store"} { .cat }
```

## Features

- Local-first append-only store
- Content-addressable storage for large payloads
