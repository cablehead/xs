## About

cross.stream is a local-first [event stream](#whats-an-event-streaming-store)
store that turns any CLI tool into a reactive component. Stream data through
Nushell pipelines, spawn external processes as
[generators](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/reference/generators/), and build
[handlers](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/reference/handlers/) that
automatically respond to events.

Unlike traditional databases that store state, cross.stream captures the _flow_
of events over time. This enables patterns like real-time monitoring, automated
workflows, and connecting different tools through event streams. You can pipe
data from one tool to another, trigger actions based on specific events, or
simply log and replay sequences of commands.

Whether you're building personal automation, prototyping distributed systems, or
experimenting with data pipelines, cross.stream provides a foundation for
event-driven computing on your local machine.

## What's an event streaming store?

If you think of an "event" like a frame in a movie‚Äîa small package on a
timeline‚Äîan event streaming store is a database designed to record these frames
in strict order, append-only, so they can be replayed or reacted to later.

For example, you might append a frame every time a message is
[posted in a specific Discord channel](examples/discord-bot). You can then
[`.cat`](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/reference/xs-nu/#cat) the stream to
review all captured messages, and‚Äîif you're in a
[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh) session‚Äîuse pipelines to filter, aggregate, or
process them with a CLI tool.

## Quick Start

See the
[installation guide](https://cablehead.github.io/xs/getting-started/installation/)
to get started.

## Features

- **Reactive Workflows**: Build handlers that automatically respond to events as
  they flow through the stream
- **CLI Integration**: Turn any command-line tool into a streaming component
  with generators
- **Nushell Native**: First-class integration with Nushell for powerful data
  processing pipelines
- **Real-time Streaming**: Subscribe to live event feeds and build responsive
  applications
- **Content Addressable**: Efficient storage and deduplication of large payloads
- **Local-first**: Your data stays on your machine, no cloud dependencies
  required
